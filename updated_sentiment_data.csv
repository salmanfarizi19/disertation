Indonesian presidential candidate Anies Baswedan at a campaign rally, January 8, 2024. After reviewing the foreign policy platforms of two of Indonesia’s three presidential candidates, Prabowo Subianto and Ganjar Pranowo, this article will extend this analysis to the third and final candidate, Anies Baswedan. Since announcing his candidacy in September 2023, this former governor of Jakarta has run with a narrative of “change,” and has opposed many of President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s policies. Anies is arguably knowledgeable in international affairs, considering his educational background and experience during his Jakarta’s gubernatorial term. During his leadership in Jakarta, he was involved in many international events, from hosting the Urban 20 Mayor Summit to speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference. He has actively presented his ideas during dialogues, hosted by CSIS, FPCI, and AMCHAM with an emphasis on Indonesia’s foreign policy. But it is definitely not enough to conclude that his stance is more acceptable with Indonesia’s reality today. His campaign manifesto proposes to create an “Indonesia fair and prosperous for all,” signaling the importance of economic equality. He argues that the fruits of Indonesia’s economic development have been unequally distributed. Under their campaign slogan “One Prosperity,” Anies and his vice-presidential running-mate, Muhaimin Iskandar, have brought an almost socialist perspective to the Indonesian policy debate. So, how does this perspective factor into their stance on foreign policy? Of the eight main “visions” contained in their election manifesto, which they collectively term the “Road to Change,” one is related to international affairs. According to this section, an Anies administration will seek to “strengthen the national defense and security system, and elevate Indonesia’s role and leadership at the global level to realize our national interest and global peace.” This section of Anies’ manifesto is quite comprehensive, covering many more issues than those of the other two candidates. The first issue mentioned is “economic diplomacy,” which also apparently seems to be their priority, as it was with Jokowi. Anies plans to promote not only free trade but “fair trade” agreements and also enhance Indonesia’s partnerships at the regional and multilateral levels. The OECD, G-20, APEC, and ASEAN Economic Community are all mentioned as targets of expanded Indonesian participation. Anies also puts importance on energy security for Indonesia and expresses a desire to create new partnerships with non-traditional partners in Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. In particular, this policy is aimed at reducing and diversifying Indonesia’s sources of energy in a bid to reduce its dependency. During Anies’ conversation at the Conference on Indonesian Foreign Policy hosted by the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia in early December, he voiced some criticisms towards Jokowi’s approach to international affairs. In discussing the implementation of Indonesia’s “free and active” foreign policy principle, he mentioned that “Indonesia’s activism should be coming from the head of state,” implying that Jokowi lacked interest and knowledge in foreign policy. This comes to the first contrast, whereby Anies brings up the essence of promoting values in Indonesia’s foreign engagements, instead of adopting a policy of pragmatism. He argued that pragmatism will trap the nation into strategic limitation and prevent it from acting independently. He said that Jokowi’s economic diplomacy, which is highly based on numbers is at fundamental risk of losing values and norms, without explicitly elaborating on them. Pragmatically, he added that “Indonesia must act as the balancing power to prevent any power’s domination” in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, given the country’s strategic position, Anies also proposed that Indonesia should act “as the bridger to global connectivity initiatives, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.” The manifesto also pledges “balance” in Indonesia’s participation in a range of economic initiatives, including China’s Belt and Road Initiative, BRICS, and the World Trade Organization. The word choice of “balancing” sparked a question of how Anies’ leadership will seek to redress the imbalances in Indonesia’s foreign policy. Also during the same session, which was attended by government officials, diplomats, academics, and students, Anies proposed a concept of “proactive and inclusive diplomacy.” This referred to an effort to increase those who have a say in the foreign policy-making process, though he did not provide any details of how he would execute it. With a similar context, during the first presidential debate on December 12, 2023, Anies criticized Jokowi’s non-inclusive decision-making style, particularly regarding the transfer of the country’s capital from Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara in Kalimantan. His campaign is now promising to shelve the new capital project, arguing that it is exceedingly expensive and should not be a priority for Indonesia. Anies has also promised to boost Indonesia’s soft power through culinary diplomacy, sports, student exchanges, cultural exhibitions, humanitarian work, and inclusive tourism. In a presumed attempt to compete with Ganjar Pranowo’s “Made in Indonesia” policy, Anies has promoted the “Brand of Indonesia,” with the justification that many foreign products are manufactured in Indonesia, but not by Indonesian firms. Changing this, he argues, will require a greater investment of time and money by the government. Thomas Noto Suoneto is a foreign policy analyst and host of Foreign Policy Talks Podcast.

(AP Photo/Achmad Ibrahim)                       BANDAR LAMPUNG, Indonesia (AP) — A former Jakarta governor seeking Indonesia’s presidency said democracy is declining in the country and pledged to make changes to get it back on track. Anies Baswedan said in an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday that concerns about neutrality in the current government and the institution arose when the frontrunner in the presidential race, Prabowo Subianto, picked the son of the current president as his running mate. The issue of neutrality has not existed in Indonesia’s elections since the fall of dictator Suharto in 1998, Baswedan said. “This means that there is a decline in trust, it means that our democracy is experiencing a decline in quality, it means that many legal rules are being bent,” he said. Indonesia, with a diverse population of more than 270 million, is the world’s third-largest democracy after India and the U.S., and it has Southeast Asia’s largest economy. The Feb. 14 election will determine who will succeed the popular President Joko Widodo, who is serving his second and final term. The country’s Constitutional Court made an exception to the age requirement of 40 for vice presidential candidates that allowed Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Widodo’s son, to run at only 36. Later, the chief justice, who is Widodo’s brother-in-law, was removed by an ethics panel for failing to recuse himself and making last-minute changes to election candidacy requirements. The ruling has been a subject of heated debate in Indonesia, and Raka’s candidacy is widely seen as implicit support from Widodo for Subianto’s third bid for the presidency. Subianto has vowed to continue the president’s development plan, in what experts view as an attempt to draw on Widodo’s popularity. 
 However, the executive director of the Association for Elections and Democracy or Perludem, Titi Anggraini, believed that corruption, vote buying and lack of opposition representation in Indonesia’s parliament were also contributing to the decline of the country’s democracy. “The problem was unlikely to be solved in the near future and would likely require reforms to the current electoral system, party regulations, public funding and strict law enforcement,” Anggraini said. Baswedan and the third candidate, former Central Java Gov. Ganjar Pranowo, have stayed in the second and third positions in recent opinion polls, and he said he is staying focused on delivering his own flagship programs in a bid to ensure that February’s presidential election goes to a runoff. “I’m serious about bringing changes to the economy to make Indonesia more equal in prosperity,” he said, “We want our democracy to be returned to a real democracy and there is no more fear of expressing opinion, no more self-censorship in the media, no more criminalization of people who criticize the government.” Baswedan also said Indonesia should be more proactive globally and he planned to shift its foreign policy from a cost-benefit principle to a more value-based approach. “So, when a country invades another country, we can say this is against our basic values, even though we are friends, but if it violated rights, we can reprimand them,” Baswedan said, “If we have no values, then there is a cost-benefit relationship where we will only support countries that are profitable for us.” He alluded to Widodo’s approach being an economy-oriented foreign policy that courts trade and investment and who seeks to break into so-called nontraditional markets. “Indonesia must return to being a decisive player in international diplomacy, no longer just a spectator, and we must actively determine direction,” Baswedan said. The “president should be the commander in chief of Indonesian diplomacy on the global stage.” Baswedan, a progressive Muslim intellectual who has been considered as the “antithesis” to Widodo by many, is widely known for opposing Widodo’s brainchild of moving Indonesia’s capital from crowded Jakarta to a new capital, Nusantara. “I want to show that infrastructure development must be broader,” Baswedan said when asked about people’s worry that his stance could affect investor mood for the project. “We’ve planned to build 40 upgraded cities, not build a new city, across Indonesia so that micro-infrastructure is built,” Baswedan said, adding that micro-infrastructure such as clean water, gas, electricity improves households. Baswedan was education and culture minister before Widodo removed him from the Cabinet in 2016. Religious identity politics in the 2017 election for Jakarta governor were seen as distancing him from moderate Muslims. His choice of Muhaimin Iskandar as his running mate is viewed as an attempt to rebuild that support. Iskandar’s PKB party has strong ties with Indonesia’s largest Islamic organization, Nahdlatul Ulama, which boasts over 45 million members. Baswedan and Pranowo were neck and neck for the second spot in recent public opinion polls after he was consistently in third place for months. His intellectual performance in two televised debates has encouraged voters to choose him and increased his votes, media reports said. At campaign rallies on Sunday in Lampung province at the southern tip of Sumatra island, Baswedan was greeted by thousands of his supporters, including Islamic teachers, clerics, farmers and youth.  “I see an intelligent and energetic figure in him,” said Purwaningsih, a fruit farmer and mother of three who came to the campaign in Sidorejo village with other farmers after taking a car for two hours. “His success as Jakarta governor is a reference for us to choose him to lead Indonesia,” she said, “Hopefully he can bring about significant changes, both in the government structure and in the society, especially for farmers.” Baswedan aims to lower Indonesia’s poverty rate to 4-5% by 2029 from the current rate of 9.38%, promising to make it easier for farmers to get fertilizers and pledging economic development in rural areas. Asked about his confidence in winning the election, Baswedan said: “We are quite optimistic that the aspirations for change are very big... the people want change.” Follow AP’s Asia-Pacific coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/asia-pacific Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

https://www.deccanherald.com/world/indonesian-presidential-candidate-anies-baswedan-plans-renewables-fund-2782086,"Follow Us : Jakarta: Indonesian presidential candidate Anies Baswedan will set up an endowment fund using revenue from a planned carbon tax to finance the development of renewable energy if he wins the February 14 elections, his lead economist told Reuters. Former Jakarta governor Anies is one of three candidates hoping to take over from President Joko Widodo, whose second and final term is due to end next year. Anies will levy a carbon tax on greenhouse gas emitted by polluting industries and place the revenue on what he will call the Resource Endowment Fund, said Wijayanto Samirin from Anies' team. With a 10 trillion-rupiah ($645.6 million) seed capital from the state budget, the fund is expected to finance geothermal exploration and renewables research, he said. ""The endowment fund is to guarantee that the money will really be allocated on efforts to cut carbon emissions. It will not go into the government's pocket and be used for other purposes,"" Wijayanto said. Jokowi, as the incumbent is popularly known, passed a law in 2021 to serve as a legal basis for his government to impose a carbon tax, but the levy has been delayed indefinitely to protect economic growth. Sitting on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia has around 24 gigawatts of geothermal potential, the world's second-largest, but has only utilised around 10 per cent of this, according to state energy company Pertamina. Geothermal exploration is expensive and risky, deterring investment, said Wijayanto. If the government could compile reliable data on proven reserves, it would reduce investment risks. Anies aims to increase the proportion of renewables in Indonesia's energy mix to 22-25 per cent by 2029, from around 12 per cent now. Jokowi had targeted 23 per cent by 2025, but he recently conceded that would be missed. Over half of Indonesia's electricity is currently powered by coal. Recent opinion surveys have put Anies last in the presidential race, behind Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto and former Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowo. Prabowo and Ganjar have both considered pushing to end the state power utility's monopoly as part of efforts to speed up the transition to greener energy, their teams told Reuters.

                            The former education and culture minister is now the dark horse candidate expected to face frontrunner and Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto in any potential second-round runoff vote.

                         Former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan has portrayed himself as the anti-establishment candidate in the presidential campaign, climbing to second place in polls on the back of a message that includes opposing a costly capital move to East Kalimantan. The former education and culture minister is now the dark horse candidate expected to face frontrunner and Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto in any potential second-round runoff vote. He had been floundering in last place but in recent weeks his opposition to President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo's legacy move to shift the country's political center away from Jakarta has helped his campaign come alive. A former lecturer, the 54-year-old has been viewed as outclassing his rivals in the presidential debates and praised for offering an alternative, with rights groups complaining of democratic gains being rolled back under Jokowi. In an interview with AFP in December, Anies said if elected he would govern from Jakarta instead of the planned capital Nusantara, set to open in August. ""Is it ready? The readiest infrastructure is here,"" he said, referring to the current capital. He has also pledged to strengthen the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) to root out graft. Anies was a minister under Jokowi before becoming Jakarta governor in 2017. But on the campaign trail he has attacked Jokowi's administration on freedom of speech and nepotism, pressuring Prabowo, who chose Jokowi's eldest son as his running mate. His agenda of change has caught on with conservative Islamic factions in the world's most populous Muslim-majority country.

The strategy appears to be taking him closer to a second-round clash after overtaking former Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowo in the polls. ""Ganjar is trending downward, Anies is trending upward,"" said Djayadi Hanan, executive director of independent pollster Lembaga Survei Indonesia. ""Anies runs with the grand narrative of change. Ganjar is unclear."" Anies was born in West Java and later studied in Japan and the United States, obtaining a doctorate in political science. The father-of-four studied in Yogyakarta and became a rector of a Jakarta university in 2007. He himself moderated the presidential debates in 2009 but now finds himself at the center of them.

He was rewarded with a ministerial position after his boss' win, but left office after less than two years, with Jokowi giving no reason for his removal. During his campaign for Jakarta governor, Anies was accused of stoking religious divides and courting the Islamic vote against the Christian incumbent, Basuki Tjahaja “Ahok” Purnama, an ally of Jokowi. Anies was a popular governor of Jakarta, more than doubling public transportation coverage across the city in his five-year term. But his tenure was marked by efforts to undermine the legacy of his predecessor, including by discontinuing his flagship program of regular river dredging to stem floods. Now, Anies will seek to replace his former boss despite all the signs pointing to Prabowo, aiming for an upset in the world's third-biggest democracy. © 2016 - 2024 PT. Bina Media Tenggara

https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3243579/indonesia-election-2024-can-attacking-jokowis-legacy-nusantara-project-help-anies-baswedan-polls,"But Anies, who is a former governor of Jakarta, took direct aim at Nusantara and Widodo’s legacy on Sunday, arguing the project could exacerbate Indonesia’s already deep inequalities. “What’s needed in Indonesia today is equitable growth, where development is carried out not just in one location, but in many locations. Don’t let us build only in one location, which will actually create new inequality,” he said. “We are preparing a programme structure to be able to encourage villages to further develop, for small towns to become medium, and medium ones to become large throughout Indonesia,” Anies added. This is not the first time that Anies, trailing behind in third place in recent polls, has criticised Nusantara, but the remark was one of his sharpest attacks yet against the highly popular outgoing president. Ahmad Syaikhu, president of the Prosperous Justice Party that belongs to Anies’ coalition, also told the media on Sunday if Anies were to win next year’s election, plans to move the capital from Jakarta would be cancelled. Analysts say Nusantara is likely to be an increasingly controversial issue in the run-up to February’s vote. “Nusantara has been sort of a centrepiece project for the Jokowi administration,” said Ian Wilson, a senior lecturer who specialises in Indonesian politics at Murdoch University in Perth, referring to the president by his nickname. “I don’t think Nusantara per se is of huge importance to Indonesians, but it does touch on other issues like the allocation of state resources,” he added. “It is a huge drain on the public purse in Indonesia, and there’s a solid argument that these resources should be used on public infrastructures like health.” 02:44 Indonesia passes law to relocate capital from Jakarta to Borneo  Survey results over the past year have shown mixed results in terms of public support for Nusantara. In July, a poll by Indostrategic showed only 40.1 per cent of respondents agreed with moving the capital city. Of the 57.3 who disagreed, the main reason was that the money for the project could go to more pressing developmental issues in Indonesia. Another survey released in October by Indikator Politik showed 56.2 per cent of people supported the plan. “Only borderline 50 per cent of the population, and in some surveys lower than that number, show support for the idea, but a greater proportion of people seem sceptical as to the capacity of the government to pull it off.” Wilson said. Nusantara is therefore a controversial enough issue for Anies to campaign on, observers say, since his criticisms could resonate with large segments of the population. In Nusantara, Anies may have found another divisive issue to centre his campaign around. “I think when cost-of-living pressures and a whole heap of other issues are impacting Indonesians’ everyday lives, to see this amount of money being spent on [Nusantara] is something that political opponents could capture,” Wilson said. However, even if Anies won, it is unclear if he could completely pull the plug on Nusantara, as Widodo has already put some guarantees in place to future-proof his flagship project after his departure. The National Capital City Law, passed by parliament in January 2022, makes it mandatory for the next president to see the development of the project through. Still, D. Nicky Fahrizal, a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Jakarta, said there were ways that the law could still be revised by another leader, such as by gaining a majority of seats in parliament and issuing an emergency regulation, known as a Perppu, to overrule it. Following the recent criticisms, Widodo defended the Nusantara project in a social media post on Wednesday. “Why are we building the [it]? We want to create economic equality, equal population distribution, and foster new economic growth points. We want Indonesia-centric development, where there is also economic growth on other islands,” he wrote. According to Widodo, part of the impetus for Nusantara is to expand economic development to different parts of Indonesia’s vast archipelago beyond the densely populated island of Java. But some people see Nusantara as a way to “abandon Jakarta to its fate” as it sinks due to excessive groundwater extraction, Wilson said. Analysts warn that failing to complete the Nusantara project could deal a significant blow to Widodo’s legacy. It is a real possibility, even without the threat of a successor undoing his plans, as funding for the project has already become a critical concern. “One significant reason why [Nusantara] has not secured a definite investor lies in the perception that the plan to relocate the capital is hasty,” Nicky from CSIS said. Given the challenges facing Nusantara and those Anies faces in the polls, it seems likely that he will continue to press on with his criticism of the project in hopes of turning the tide against Prabowo. Only time will tell if such a strategy works in his favour.",2 stars,0.38375704884529116

There has been significant doubt over Anies Baswedan’s electability in the 2024 presidential election. However, surveys on Anies’s electability in the past two months indicated a slight but steady rise. IRMAN G. LANTI and ADHI PRIAMARIZKI discuss Anies’s presidential campaign strategy, its challenges, and opportunities.          After languishing in the polls as a distant third all year round, ex-Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan’s bid for the Indonesian presidency has caught a second wind among growing concerns about political dynasties and potential election interference by the incumbent president. Protest voters frustrated with the Indonesian political scene has started to flock to Anies, who is now in good position to compete with former Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo for second place. Having campaigned as an opposition candidate from the very beginning, Anies is better positioned than Ganjar to fly the opposition flag. Who is Anies Baswedan and how is he positioning his candidacy to expand his supporter base? How can he strengthen his electability moving into the official campaign season? These questions will be addressed in this piece. Anies: A Reluctant Religious Conservative Anies hails from a family of Muslim political activists. His grandfather, A. R. Baswedan, founded the Indonesian Arab Party and later joined Masyumi, a modernist Islamic party, in the 1950s. A student activist during his university years in Gajah Mada, Anies was part of the Islamic Student Union (HMI). Subsequently, he pursued further studies in the United States and developed an affinity for progressive issues such as democracy, pluralism, and gender equality. After returning to Indonesia, Anies became Indonesia’s youngest rector at the University of Paramadina, established by Nurcholish Madjid, a prominent progressive Islamic thinker in Indonesia. During his time at Paramadina, he pioneered the “Teach Indonesia” movement, funding young university students for one-year stints in remote regions to serve the local community as teachers. These progressive and reformist credentials led him to eventually join Jokowi’s first election campaign in 2014 as campaign spokesperson and subsequently as education minister. However, his track record as a progressive academic has been marred by the political compromises he made to win the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election. Anies saw an opportunity to exploit identity politics against incumbent Governor Ahok, a Chinese Christian, to gain the support of conservative Islamic groups. Although Anies later tried to govern Jakarta in an inclusive manner, his main constituents (progressive, minority, and educated voters) remained deeply ambivalent about how he came to power in 2017. Anies’s Coalition: Overcoming Strange Bedfellows  Anies is supported by a three-party coalition consisting of the Nasdem (National Democrat) Party, the modernist Islamic party PKS (Partai Keadilan Sejahtera – Justice Prosperous Party), and the traditionalist Muslim party PKB (Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa – National Awakening Party). The latest survey results show that Anies is polling behind Prabowo in key provinces with large numbers of modernist and conservative Muslims (Banten, West Java, and West Sumatra). Anies is only doing well in Jakarta. This circumstance requires Anies’s coalition parties, notably PKB and PKS, to maximise their political machinery to improve the former Jakarta governor’s chance of winning the presidential race. In East Java, a province where PKB dominates, Anies is trailing behind the other candidates. There is no clear sign that Anies is attractive to the traditionalist Muslims in the province. Additionally, the inclusion of Mahfud MD, a native of Madura, as Ganjar Pranowo’s vice-presidential candidate has toughened the East Java battleground. Despite the bleak progress, PKB can still overcome the situation by maximising the contribution of its cadre and key figures. Indikator’s November survey indicated that PKB votes are the most fragmented in comparison to PKS and Nasdem in supporting their presidential candidate pair. Thus, internal consolidation, including the party’s influence over local Islamic boarding schools, will be key for PKB to maximise its political machinery. Unlike PKB, PKS has been showing a relatively united front in supporting Anies’s candidacy. Nonetheless, PKS does not possess superb electoral dominance. While PKS dominates in the urban areas of West Java and West Sumatera, and owns significant vote share in Jakarta, it is not enough to single-handedly rule them. On the other hand, the possibility of securing a larger Muslim vote share from the alliance of PKB and PKS remains to be seen. However, these two parties can help secure some Muslim segments that are closely associated with each of them. PKS and PKB were also in the same team back in the 2009 presidential election, when they supported President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s re-election. Preserving the Right, Capturing the Middle  Anies’s coalition seems to believe that for him to win enough votes to head to the runoff election, he needs to consolidate support not just from his Islamist base and voters who disapprove of Jokowi’s government (~20-25% of voters) but also from those who like his technocratic track record and progressive ideas. However, Anies has established a reputation of being involved with the far right of the Islamic spectrum primarily during his campaign in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election. Thus, capturing the middle voters will be beneficial in increasing his electability. His quest to gain the middle ground is reflected in the way he supported religious and ethnic minorities’ activities during his time as governor of Jakarta. He also attempts to portray himself as the face of an educated and modern Indonesian, which contradicts Jokowi’s image of an ordinary person (orang biasa). Another interesting point is Anies’s liberal idea of global citizenship during his foreign policy speech at a seminar conducted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Indonesia. Furthermore, he has been highlighting the current administration’s failure in ensuring inclusive economic development. In addition to his attempt to capture the middle, Anies also entertains his conservative Islamic sympathisers. Recently, two Islamic hardliner groups, 212 Alumni Association (PA 212) and National Cleric’s Fatwa Defender Movement (GNPF Ulama), convened the ijtima ulama (cleric congregation) and declared support for the Anies-Muhaiman pair. The event hinted at continued relations between Anies and those hardliners. It is implicitly acknowledged that these hardliners have nowhere to go but Anies’s camp, as they labelled Prabowo a traitor when he joined Jokowi’s cabinet and are against the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP)’s nationalist-secularist ideology. Moreover, the 212 network currently has no cause to champion and is experiencing a generational shift of charismatic clerics, making it a weaker movement compared to the one in 2017. Momentum and Opportunities A couple months ago, Anies’s idea of proposing change perhaps gained little traction among Indonesians. However, the recent Constitutional Court saga and Jokowi’s political dynasty have provided a small window of momentum for Anies. Anies may gain additional momentum if he can take advantage of economic populist issues, notably the widening income inequality, and double down on his platform as a progressive technocratic reformer. Regardless of the outcome, Anies’s participation in the 2024 presidential election can solidify his voter base, which will come in handy for his future political endeavours.   Irman G.

There has been significant doubt over Anies Baswedan’s electability in the 2024 presidential election. However, surveys on Anies’s electability in the past two months indicated a slight but steady rise. IRMAN G. LANTI and ADHI PRIAMARIZKI discuss Anies’s presidential campaign strategy, its challenges, and opportunities.          After languishing in the polls as a distant third all year round, ex-Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan’s bid for the Indonesian presidency has caught a second wind among growing concerns about political dynasties and potential election interference by the incumbent president. Protest voters frustrated with the Indonesian political scene has started to flock to Anies, who is now in good position to compete with former Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo for second place. Having campaigned as an opposition candidate from the very beginning, Anies is better positioned than Ganjar to fly the opposition flag. Who is Anies Baswedan and how is he positioning his candidacy to expand his supporter base? How can he strengthen his electability moving into the official campaign season? These questions will be addressed in this piece. Anies: A Reluctant Religious Conservative Anies hails from a family of Muslim political activists. His grandfather, A. R. Baswedan, founded the Indonesian Arab Party and later joined Masyumi, a modernist Islamic party, in the 1950s. A student activist during his university years in Gajah Mada, Anies was part of the Islamic Student Union (HMI). Subsequently, he pursued further studies in the United States and developed an affinity for progressive issues such as democracy, pluralism, and gender equality. After returning to Indonesia, Anies became Indonesia’s youngest rector at the University of Paramadina, established by Nurcholish Madjid, a prominent progressive Islamic thinker in Indonesia. During his time at Paramadina, he pioneered the “Teach Indonesia” movement, funding young university students for one-year stints in remote regions to serve the local community as teachers. These progressive and reformist credentials led him to eventually join Jokowi’s first election campaign in 2014 as campaign spokesperson and subsequently as education minister. However, his track record as a progressive academic has been marred by the political compromises he made to win the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election. Anies saw an opportunity to exploit identity politics against incumbent Governor Ahok, a Chinese Christian, to gain the support of conservative Islamic groups. Although Anies later tried to govern Jakarta in an inclusive manner, his main constituents (progressive, minority, and educated voters) remained deeply ambivalent about how he came to power in 2017. Anies’s Coalition: Overcoming Strange Bedfellows  Anies is supported by a three-party coalition consisting of the Nasdem (National Democrat) Party, the modernist Islamic party PKS (Partai Keadilan Sejahtera – Justice Prosperous Party), and the traditionalist Muslim party PKB (Partai Kebangkitan Bangsa – National Awakening Party). The latest survey results show that Anies is polling behind Prabowo in key provinces with large numbers of modernist and conservative Muslims (Banten, West Java, and West Sumatra). Anies is only doing well in Jakarta. This circumstance requires Anies’s coalition parties, notably PKB and PKS, to maximise their political machinery to improve the former Jakarta governor’s chance of winning the presidential race. In East Java, a province where PKB dominates, Anies is trailing behind the other candidates. There is no clear sign that Anies is attractive to the traditionalist Muslims in the province. Additionally, the inclusion of Mahfud MD, a native of Madura, as Ganjar Pranowo’s vice-presidential candidate has toughened the East Java battleground. Despite the bleak progress, PKB can still overcome the situation by maximising the contribution of its cadre and key figures. Indikator’s November survey indicated that PKB votes are the most fragmented in comparison to PKS and Nasdem in supporting their presidential candidate pair. Thus, internal consolidation, including the party’s influence over local Islamic boarding schools, will be key for PKB to maximise its political machinery. Unlike PKB, PKS has been showing a relatively united front in supporting Anies’s candidacy. Nonetheless, PKS does not possess superb electoral dominance. While PKS dominates in the urban areas of West Java and West Sumatera, and owns significant vote share in Jakarta, it is not enough to single-handedly rule them. On the other hand, the possibility of securing a larger Muslim vote share from the alliance of PKB and PKS remains to be seen. However, these two parties can help secure some Muslim segments that are closely associated with each of them. PKS and PKB were also in the same team back in the 2009 presidential election, when they supported President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s re-election. Preserving the Right, Capturing the Middle  Anies’s coalition seems to believe that for him to win enough votes to head to the runoff election, he needs to consolidate support not just from his Islamist base and voters who disapprove of Jokowi’s government (~20-25% of voters) but also from those who like his technocratic track record and progressive ideas. However, Anies has established a reputation of being involved with the far right of the Islamic spectrum primarily during his campaign in the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election. Thus, capturing the middle voters will be beneficial in increasing his electability. His quest to gain the middle ground is reflected in the way he supported religious and ethnic minorities’ activities during his time as governor of Jakarta. He also attempts to portray himself as the face of an educated and modern Indonesian, which contradicts Jokowi’s image of an ordinary person (orang biasa). Another interesting point is Anies’s liberal idea of global citizenship during his foreign policy speech at a seminar conducted by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Indonesia. Furthermore, he has been highlighting the current administration’s failure in ensuring inclusive economic development. In addition to his attempt to capture the middle, Anies also entertains his conservative Islamic sympathisers. Recently, two Islamic hardliner groups, 212 Alumni Association (PA 212) and National Cleric’s Fatwa Defender Movement (GNPF Ulama), convened the ijtima ulama (cleric congregation) and declared support for the Anies-Muhaiman pair. The event hinted at continued relations between Anies and those hardliners. It is implicitly acknowledged that these hardliners have nowhere to go but Anies’s camp, as they labelled Prabowo a traitor when he joined Jokowi’s cabinet and are against the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP)’s nationalist-secularist ideology. Moreover, the 212 network currently has no cause to champion and is experiencing a generational shift of charismatic clerics, making it a weaker movement compared to the one in 2017. Momentum and Opportunities A couple months ago, Anies’s idea of proposing change perhaps gained little traction among Indonesians. However, the recent Constitutional Court saga and Jokowi’s political dynasty have provided a small window of momentum for Anies. Anies may gain additional momentum if he can take advantage of economic populist issues, notably the widening income inequality, and double down on his platform as a progressive technocratic reformer. Regardless of the outcome, Anies’s participation in the 2024 presidential election can solidify his voter base, which will come in handy for his future political endeavours.   Irman G.

Kirimkan Lagi Sekarang Translator Dewi Elvia Muthiariny Editor Petir Garda Bhwana 30 January 2024 10:21 WIB TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Presidential candidate number 1 Anies Baswedan pledged huge investment in the arts and cultural sector if he wins the 2024 presidential election. He made the vow in response to the national dangdut legend Rhoma Irama who expressed concern over the fate of Indonesian music and film artists. “I call it investment. Why? Because expenses are often referred to as costs. Because they are costs, we try to keep them as low as possible, as efficient as possible. In investment, we talk about what will be produced,” Anies said at his Desak & Slepet AMIN event in Jakarta on Monday, January 29. Rhoma Irama, the Indonesian Dangdut King, said he was worried that foreign cultures are becoming more popular, while national art resources are not yet able to generate foreign exchange. Anies then cited the experience of South Korea in the 1980s to early 1990s, which seriously invested in artistic workers. This was evident in the massive construction of performance venues and the state's presence to support them. The former governor of Jakarta also said that he had met with cultural figures in Bandung and shared plans to build world-class cultural performance centers in major cities across the archipelago. “And then to encourage arts development by building art schools in various regions. So that art schools are not just in certain cities,” he added. Anies Baswedan stressed that these measures are necessary as creativity will determine the nation's success. “[We will] allocate a sufficient budget, spaces for artists to express themselves. Inshallah, this will increase their welfare, and we will help prepare social security for arts workers for their peace of mind.” ANTARA Editor's Choice: Top 8 Countries with Largest Nickel Reserves in the World Click here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News Recommended Asia Pacific Internet Community in Bali; Discusses Recent Attack on Indonesia's National Data Center 16 minutes ago Indonesia's Energy Ministry Says Coconut-Based Jet Fuel Possible 48 minutes ago Muhaimin Iskandar Compares Jokowi to Soeharto in Political Dynasty Context 52 minutes ago Today's Top 3 News: Tax Exemptions, Foreign Ownership Among Govt Incentives for SEZ Investors in Indonesia 1 hours ago Indonesian Police Bust Trafficking Ring Exploiting Women in Sydney 1 hours ago Amnesty International Indonesia Urges DPR to Delay Ratification of Police Law 2 hours ago Rupiah Inches Up as China Central Bank Cuts Interest Rate 3 hours ago Sales Office Travel Fair; Garuda Indonesia Offers Up to 80% Discount on Flights 5 hours ago Jokowi Inks Decree on Mining Permit Transfers to Mass Groups, Only PBNU Is Ready So Far 6 hours ago President Jokowi Praises Papua's Bright Human Capital 7 hours ago NewJeans Pop-Up Store in Jakarta Offers How Sweet Merch 3 jam lalu NewJeans, the girl group under ADOR, is treating its fans once again with a pop-up store in Jakarta!

 Share: ""We don't allow any more situations where people are afraid, so I convey Wakanda no more, Indonesia forever,"" said Anies Baswedan, who was greeted by applause from his supporters. This sentence was conveyed by Anies Baswedan as a closing statement or closing statement at the debate of the first edition presidential and vice president candidates organized by the General Elections Commission (KPU) on Tuesday (12/12/2023) night. The sentence of Wakanda no more, Indonesia forever immediately became a hot topic of conversation among residents, after the inaugural debate was completed. The term Wakanda is very popular among the public, especially young people. Quoting Dictionary.com, Wakanda is a fictitious country in the series of Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films, and became the birthplace of one of their superheroes, Black Panther. In the film, Wakanda is described as a closed country but has advanced technology thanks to the use of vibranium. Wakanda residents also really appreciate and maintain their culture. In Indonesia, Wakanda is often used by netizens for expression or comment on everything that has a negative stigma in the country. Wakanda is also often used to describe disappointment, and satire, both against the government and law enforcement. People can easily find the word Wakanda on social media. One example is, 'Only in the country of Wakanda, law enforcers only act after it goes viral.' Wakanda said in the sentence is to replace Indonesia. It is a bit ironic, when the Wakanda, which is described as very positive in the series of MCU films, actually has a negative connotation in Indonesia. Political Communication Expert from Padjadjaran University Bandung, Kunto Adi Wibowo said Indonesia's replacement with Wakanda was a form of satire for repressive actions taken by the government. ""That's right, satire for repressive actions. Wakanda is a kind of chaos or a kind of euphemism about Indonesia which is very unsafe, why are people afraid, so if there is a corruption case or a case of persecution, we will call it Wakanda, right,"" said Kunto. Wakanda no more, Indonesia forever. ☝🏻#AMINAjaDulu #DebatCapres #PemiluDamai2024 pic.twitter.com/GnSXouvSnV Wakanda no more, Indonesia forever. #AMINAjaDulu #DebatCapres #PemiluDamai2024 pic.twitter.com/GnSXouvSnV ""People's fear or some kind of insult that ideal Indonesia doesn't exist, the existence of Wakanda,"" he continued. It is not known who first used Wakanda to mention Indonesia on social media. However, according to a number of sources, in disguise the word Indonesia was carried out by netizens to avoid the Electronic Information and Transactions Law (UU ITE). As is known, the ITE Law is often used to silence criticism, or as a tool to threaten someone who criticizes. According to a report by the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet), as many as 393 people were charged with Article ITE Law in the 2013-2021 period. Based on the background, in 2021 the victims of the ITE Law which came from activists reached 10 people or 26.3 percent of the total victims. Eight people (21.1 percent) were victims of violence, and seven people (18.4 percent) came from the community. Other victims come from journalists, academics, students, laborers, politicians, and community organizations. ""In terms of freedom of expression, more and more public officials use the rubber article Law No. 11 of 2008 concerning Electronic Information and Transactions (UU ITE) to silence the voices of critical groups,"" said SAFEnet in the Indonesia 2021 Digital Rights Situation Report. Wakanda went viral after the first debate of the 2024 presidential election. Anies Baswedan used Wakanda in his closing sentence at the debate. Throughout the debate, this number one presidential candidate often mentions the freedom of confinement, not to mention the law which according to him is ""sharp downwards, blunt upwards"". Anies also mentioned the millennials and Generation Z who criticized the government for being often faced with violence. Then, for young people, our young people are all aware of this election about the future. You are the owner of the future. I'm sure you will choose to be serious about becoming president, not playing for president,"" Anies said in the closing sentence of the debate. ""And when we talk about the future, then I want to convey to everyone, freedom of expression will be guaranteed. We don't allow any more situations where people are afraid. Therefore, I say, Wakanda no more, Indonesia forever,"" concluded Anies while crossing his hand in the style of Black Panther. literally, Wakanda no more in Indonesian is 'there is no more Wakanda'. Through this sentence, Anies Baswedan wants to convince the public that if he is elected president next year, then there is no need to use the word Wakanda to criticize the bad things that happen in Indonesia. Anies wants to ensure that freedom of expression will be given as widely as possible if he sits in the RI1 seat. Using the word Wakanda which is synonymous with young people, Anies Baswedan also uses it to attract the attention of millennials and Z. As is known, more than 50 percent of voters in the upcoming 2024 presidential election are novice voters. Anies Baswedan hopes to get closer to these potential voters by using terms that are root in the ears of generation Z and millennials. ""So whoever wants to win, or if they want to choose a leader who brings new changes, they must be able to win the voices of young friends because they are significant,"" said Executive Director of the Elections Association for Democracy (Perludem), Khoirunnisa Nur Agustyanti.

                            By signing an “integrity pact” with a group of conservative ulamas (Islamic scholars), presidential candidate Anies Baswedan may be gaining some extra votes.

                         By signing an “integrity pact” with a group of conservative ulamas (Islamic scholars), presidential candidate Anies Baswedan may be gaining some extra votes. But he could also lose the support of a large segment of voters who are not comfortable with the group’s Islamist agenda. News of the deal was disclosed by the Ijtima Ulama last week, which said signing the pact was a condition of the group’s endorsement of Anies, one of the three contestants in the Feb. 14, 2024, presidential election. It was not immediately clear when Anies and his running mate Muhaimin Iskandar had signed the deal, but the group said it sent the document on Nov. 19. Ijtima Ulama and National Public Figures is a group of mostly conservative ulamas, including the once-firebrand Rizieq Shihab. It made its biggest impact during the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial election. The group organized a mass rally in Jakarta on Dec. 2, 2016, to oppose the reelection bid of incumbent governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama, a Christian of Chinese descent, accusing him of blasphemy against Islam. Challenger Anies beat Ahok in the run-off, which many said would have been impossible without the support of the conservative ulama movement. Now with his sights on the presidency, Anies may find his association with the conservative ulamas more of a liability. One of their leaders, Rizieq, has been silenced after serving a jail term for violating the COVID-19 pandemic mobility restrictions. His Islam Defenders’ Front (FPI), notorious for attacking and harassing minorities and anyone considered un-Islamic, has been outlawed. It has resurfaced with a new name, the Islamic Brotherhood Front, with same initials, but it has lost its sting. The conservative ulamas may not be all that effective at mobilizing voters. In the 2019 presidential race, Ijtima Ulama got challenger Prabowo Subianto to sign its integrity pact in return for its endorsement. Prabowo went on to lose the election to incumbent President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo for the second time. Now running for the third time, Prabowo, whom surveys put as the frontrunner, is likely glad to be rid of the group. Anies, who is trailing a distant second or third, along with Ganjar Pranowo, will need all the votes he can get, but aligning with the conservative ulamas may not be the answer and may even be counterproductive. Anies has been struggling to shake off the stigma that comes with his association with the religious conservatism promulgated by the ulama group. He does not really need their endorsement given that his presidential ticket is already sponsored by two large Islam-based parties: the National Mandate Party (PKB), which his running mate Muhaimin chairs and is the party of the Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia’s largest Islamic mass organization, as well as the Justice Welfare Party (PKS), which runs on an Islamist platform. The largest party in the coalition supporting Anies is the NasDem Party, which runs on a nationalist-secular platform. What’s more Muslims make up nearly 90 percent of the population but they don’t represent a single voting bloc in elections. The majority of Muslims will vote for secular parties, and in the past only about 20 percent of voters chose Islam-based parties. The PKB and PKS are two of six Islam-based parties contesting in 2024. Ijtima Ulama is a small lobby group of conservative ulamas trying to find their place in the country’s political landscape. Anies has since confirmed that he and Muhaimin signed the integrity pact. “We are open to any expression of support. It’s a two-way thing, they give their support, and we give our commitments, which must still conform with the principles of statehood, [state ideology] Pancasila and the Constitution,” he said, implying the initiative had come from the ulamas rather than him. Many of the 13 points of the integrity pact are not deeply conservative. They relate to commitments to fight secularism, Islamophobia, terrorism, separatism, imperialism and prevent the return of communism. They demand commitment to the eradication of corruption and the protection of human rights and freedom of expression, as well as support for an independent Palestinian state. The points reflecting the ulamas’ conservative agenda include calls to use blasphemy laws against those who offend religions, to respect ulamas and pay heed to their opinions and to stop the supposed persecution of ulamas. The latter is in an apparent reference to the jailing of Rizieq, under almost any pretext, to silence him. Although already out of jail, he is on probation until June 2024, so his ability to speak publicly is limited. It is not so much the substance of the integrity pact that voters will pay heed to. It is Anies’ association with the group, which could be a plus for conservative voters but a big turn-off for other voters. Since Anies’ ticket is already supported by the PKB and PKS, he already had the conservative Muslim vote in his pocket without signing the pact. What we’ve heard Two close associates of Anies said that the Assembly of Ulema convention was held to shift the support of its followers from Prabowo to Anies. The internal team of the presidential candidate had discovered through a survey that hardline Muslim community preferred Prabowo Subianto as president in 2024 as they did in 2019. According to the sources, Anies's team is not worried about negative reactions from moderate Muslim voters and minority groups. They said Anies would intensify efforts to reach out to moderate Muslims and minority groups. ""Both the moderate and right-wing Islamic groups don't have many options other than supporting Anies,"" one of the sources said. Furthermore, Anies has been trying to remove the stigma as a champion of identity politics by attending more activities organized by non-Muslim communities. One of Anies's campaign team members said the former Jakarta governor would join a Christmas safari organized by the National Awakening Party (PKB). During the event, Anies will offer a political contract with the minority groups, similar to a pact he signed with the urban poor network ahead of the Jakarta election in 2017.

                            Presidential candidate Anies Baswedan highlighted the critical roles of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) in the country's economic development.

                         Presidential candidate Anies Baswedan has pledged to promote equal opportunities for business owners and to create more jobs. “We want to create equal opportunities for growth, accompanied by equal and sustainable development,” he said during a dialogue with Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) leaders on Thursday in Jakarta, as quoted by the Antara news agency. To achieve this goal, Anies plans to introduce the One Economy (Satu Perekonomian) program if elected. In this initiative, Anies outlines two steps, with the first involving the establishment of a conducive business environment by improving legal certainty, long-term planning and simplifying permits.  The second step would see the reduction of living costs and the generation of employment opportunities. To do this, Anies plans to enhance food governance and develop 40 cities to bolster economic centers. “I met numerous individuals in various regions,” Anies said. “They mentioned high living and production costs.” Through the One Economy initiative, Anies aims for even economic growth, open job opportunities, affordable logistics, legal certainty and a streamlined bureaucracy. This economic development is expected to result in an improved Human Development Index (HDI) across Indonesia. Anies said Kadin has three strategic roles in the country’s economic development: as a strategic partner to the government in driving business activities, as a promoter of industry progress at national and international levels and as a catalyst for driving the national and regional economies. © 2016 - 2024 PT.

                        Calon Presiden Nomor Urut 01, Anies Baswedan, menegaskan dirinya dengan calon Wakil Presdien Muhaimin Iskandar akan menjamin kebebasan berpendapat di Indonesia bila terpilih memimpin negeri. Anies tak mau lagi ada rakyat yang takut menyuarakan pendapat.

""Saya sampaikan, Wakanda no more, Indonesia forever,"" ucap Anies dalam debat perdana Pilpres 2024 di Kantor KPU, Jakarta, Selasa, 12 Desember 2023.

Wakanda kerap jadi istilah pengganti bagi mereka yang menyampaikan kritik terkait situasi Indonesia terkini. Nama Indonesia diganti menjadi Wakanda.

Anies yakin rakyat dan seluruh pihak menginginkan praktik korupsi diberantas hingga tuntas. Kemudian, pemerintah memberikan pelayanan yang terbagi bagi rakyat.

""Serta menjunjung tinggi etika,"" ujar dia.

Anies menilai saat ini Indonesia tengah ada di persimpangan jalan antara tetap menjadi negara hukum atau negara kekuasaan. ""Kita ingin mengembalikan, di mana negara menjadi negara hukum,"" tegas Anies.

Dia juga menyampaikan pentingnya calon pemimpin menjunjung tinggi etika. Jangan sampai ketika terjadi pelanggaran etika, justru bersembunyi di balik keputusan hukum.

""Bahwa tugas dari pimpinan tertinggi memberi contoh, ketika ada pelanggaran etika , maka itu adalah mendasar,"" tutur Anies.

Sementara itu calon presiden nomor urut 2, Prabowo Subianto, dalam pernyataan pamungkasnya mengingatkan Indonesia mendapatkan kemerdekaan melalui proses yang sangat panjang usai mendapat penindasan dari bangsa lain.

Prabowo menegaskan saat ini Indonesia sudah tumbuh menjadi bangsa berkembang dengan sistem demokrasi yang diakui dunia.

""Kita bersyukur kita sudah bangun suatu negara yang memiliki demokrasi dengan segala kekurangannya, kita bersyukur semua pemimpin telah membantu menambahkan kemajuan. Kita ingin lebih maju, kita ingin lebih baik, kita ingin lebih adil, kita ingin hilangkan kemiskinan, dan kita ingin hilangkan korupsi,"" kata Prabowo dalam debat pertama Calon Presiden 2024 di Gedung KPU RI, Jakarta, Selasa, 12 Desember 2023.

Prabowo bertekad dengan berjalan bersama Gibran Rakabuming Raka sebagai wakilnya, bersiap meneruskan pondasi yang sudah dibangun oleh pemerintah terdahulu untuk melompat menjadi negara maju dan makmur.

Dengan kemajuan yang bisa didapat, Prabowo juga meyakini Indonesia bisa menjadi negara adil terhadap rakyatnya.

""Tetapi syaratnya kita harus rukun, kita harus bersatu, kita tidak boleh menghasut, memecah belah, kita tidak boleh untuk kepentingan sesaat untuk kepentingan jangka pendek,"" pungkas Prabowo.

Di sisi lain calon presiden nomor urut 03, Ganjar Pranowo menyebut pemerintah juga tidak boleh anti kritik dan membatasi kebebasan berpendapat masyarakat. Berbagai kritik masukan dari masyarakat dan media harus dijadikan vitamin bagi pemerintah.

""Vitamin buat dirinya bukan sedang merongrong apalagi merasa terancam. Maka kalau demokratisasi ini bisa kita laksanakan dengan baik sesuai dengan amanat reformasi tidak ada lagi cerita Bu Sinta, Mas Butet, cerita Mas Melki tidak ada lagi,"" ujar dia.

Sebab dengan demikian, warga dapat dengan tenang dan tidak merasa terancam saat menyampaikan pendapat maupun kritiknya. Sebab pemerintah dapat menerima suara rakyat tersebut dan tidak 'baperan'.                     Tag MOST POPULAR terkait lainnya Metrotv © Copyright 2007 - 2024.

Sayangnya, tidak semua orang tahan untuk berada menjadi oposisi, seperti disampaikan Pak Prabowo. Pak Prabowo tidak tahan untuk menjadi oposisi. Apa yang terjadi? Beliau sendiri menyampaikan bahwa tidak berada dalam kekuasaan membuat tidak bisa berbisnis, tidak bisa berusaha. Kekuasaan lebih dari soal bisnis."" 3.

And while all these superstars are filthy rich, their wealth pales in comparison to the world’s richest actor (or actress even). This person has a staggering net worth of $8 billion (Rs 66000 crore), much more than any celeb. World’s richest actress, worth Rs 66000 crore, is... Jami Gertz is a name that not many cine fans would be familiar with. But she is the world’s richest actress and by a long margin at that. As per multiple reports, Gertz has a net worth of $8 billion (Rs 66000 crore), more than 15 times her nearest rival in the list of world’s richest actresses. Interestingly, Gertz has not had a very successful film or TV career. In fact, she does not have a single hit to her credit as a lead actress. Just how rich is Gertz? The combined wealth of the ten richest Indian actors - a list that includes Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Nagarjuna, Aamir Khan, Prabhas, and Akshay Kumar - would be less than half her net worth today. Jami Gertz’s film and television career Discovered in a talent hunt in the 80s, Jami Gertz made her debut with Endless Love in 1981, and went on to appear in supporting roles in several films over the 80s and 90s, including filler parts in iconic shows and films like Seinfeld, Twister, and Lost Boys. She is best remembered for playing Judy Miller in the 2002 TV show Still Standing, her most prominent starring role. For Twister, Gertz was even nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress. However, she did earn critical acclaim when she guest starred on the show Ally McBeal, for which she earned an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. The secret to Jami Gertz’s enormous net worth In 1989, Gertz married billionaire business executive Tony Ressler. Together, they are the co-owners of the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball, along with the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). This, along with a number of other business investments across the board, contributes to Gertz’s sizable wealth, something actors cannot hope to touch through traditional means.
